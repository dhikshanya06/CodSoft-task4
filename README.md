# CodSoft-task4
<h4>This code implements a linear regression model on an advertising dataset, splitting the data into training and testing sets. It trains the model, predicts sales, and evaluates performance using mean squared error. Visualizations include pair plots for data exploration and a scatter plot to compare actual versus predicted sales, demonstrating the model's accuracy and insights into prediction outcomes.</h4>
